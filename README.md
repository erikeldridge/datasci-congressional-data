# datasci-congressional-data
This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org) in collaboration with CSUMB Computer Science students who are completing their [capstone project](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/cst-499-computer-science-capstone-course/mentors-partners).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: [Pre-Launch]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to:

1. Analyze congressional data affecting SF and/or Monterey Bay in coordination with C4SF using the [Congressional Data Competition](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/congressional-data-competition/) as a guiding framework (not absolutely necessary to make a formal submission).
2. Display findings, eg on a website, Alexa app, etc, conformant with the Congressional Data Competition requirements
3. The work will be driven by CSUMB students and at the end of the semester the project will be sufficiently documented and in a good enough state to hand off to the broader C4SF group.

### Partner
* In parternship with CSUMB Computer Science students completing their capstone project, we will be analyzing Congressional data.
* CSUMB CST 499 Capstone Project: https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/cst-499-computer-science-capstone-course/mentors-partners
* Partner contact: Erik Eldridge, [@Erik Eldridge]

### Technologies (unclear for now, leave the defaults in)
* R 
* Python
* D3
* PostGres, MySql
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML

* etc. 

## Project Description
The Challenge framing is actually quite broad: the goal is to Create an application, website visualization, or other digital creation that helps analyze Congressional data. As we scope the project further, we will better pinpoint the exact problem we will tackle. For now, here are a list of topics that may be a good fit:

1. How many bills affect SF and/or MB?
2. Voting patterns - How has your Congressional representative voted over time? Do any factors correlate with a yes vote? Can we predict how sheâ€™ll vote on the next bill? How confident are we in the prediction? Can we establish a voting preference profile, eg trained on voter recommendations, and generate an alert when a prediction conflicts with our preference?
3. Visualizing Gerrymandering - (i.e. can we show evidence of racial gerrymandering, or other illegal/unethical gerrymandering by socio-demographic splits)
4. Campaign finance - visualizations of sources of funds over time. Is there a correlation between sources of funds and voting behavior?

As we get more specific on which problem we are tackling we will also be able to get more specific about the data sources, questions, and hypotheses we are exploring. In addition, we will specify the output that we expect along with blockers and challenges we face.

## Needs of this project

- **Project Leads** (From Code for San Francisco): We need project leads that are willing to be a point of contact for the CSUMB students and be an engaging partner in scoping out the problem. We are also considering a "Support Rotation", see proposed schedule below which would consist of a team of project leads from C4SF who will rotate each week on being the mentor.

Other Roles Include:
- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- However, we should aim that a good chunk of the project will be driven by students.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
