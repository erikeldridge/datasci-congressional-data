# Explore the data
## SQL/Python
Use basic SQL/Python to query and explore the data! We now use [Mode Analytics](https://modeanalytics.com/editor/code_for_san_francisco) as a frontend tool to query our PostgreSQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure. Ping the #datascience Slack Channel if you need access to Mode.

We've connected Mode Analytics to our PostgreSQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure. Thus, in Mode, you can create a new report and query off of our database, which is called 'data-sci-congressional-data'.

**Note, please only run "read only" queries in Mode. It is not a good idea to run DML/DDL statements that write to the database in Mode since there is no history or record of what is being done**.
