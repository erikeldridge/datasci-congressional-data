# What are Specs?

In this folder we'll store Project Specifications (a.k.a. "spec"). The purpose of writing a spec is to provide a simple but complete description of a larger piece of technical work, whether that be software, data science analysis, or something else. 

## Template

We'll use the following template for writing Specs

### Goals
In this section, state the goals of the project

### Dates
In this section, state three dates: 

1. Start Date: When the work on this project started
2. Estimated End Date: When we think we will finish the work by
3. Actual End Date: Leave this blank at the beginning. When work is actually finished, come back and fill in this.

The purpose of recording this is that it gives us a sense of how well we were able to keep to our original timeline.
    
1. If we finish much earlier than we expected, is there anything we missed? Could we have added more to the original spec (e.g. more tests)?
2. If we finish much later than expected, what were some of the blockers? Are there any lessons we can learn to take into our next project to be more efficient

### Background and Significance (why are we doing this?)
A brief description on why we want to work on this project.

### Definition of Done
How do we know when we are done? In many cases there are many paths to accomplish the goals we stated above. What is our MVP (minimum viable product)? What would we like to do beyond MVP if we have more time and what additional functionality would that give us? When are we satisfied to call this set of work "done"?

### Out of Scope
Are there any features and/or analysis that seem potentially interesting but are out of scope for this project? This section may be blank. The purpose of this section is to record anything that might seem related, out of scope for this project, but potentially tackled in a future project.
